<br/>

A first-person shooter game with sound effects and a music lerp function, I made it as part of a training program. While it is not a fully functioning game, it allowed me to develop my skills in game development and gain experience in FPS game making.

**Features:**

- Music lerp function, it changes to combat mode when enemy is close to the player and switches back again when the player is away of the enemy.
-   Contains a ragdoll that you can shoot for dynamic physics effect.
-   Includes a mini-map displaying player and enemy locations and distances
